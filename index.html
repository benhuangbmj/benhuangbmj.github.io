        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I am an educator-turned, self-taught web developer looking for full
          stack development opportunities. For years, I have been using
          programming to solve problems for myself, my colleagues, my church,
          and local small nonprofits. Now, I am looking to solve problems of
          larger scale and expand my contribution to and my influence on the
          society.
